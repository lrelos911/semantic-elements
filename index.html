      <p>Semantic elements are HTML elements integrated into the language that increase legibility when reading HTML files. Previous iterations of HTML lacked semantic elements, so programmers instead had to mark div elements liberally with class tags. With semantic elements, the class is instead indicated with an element that properly conveys what the content does without messy notation. This makes it easier for programmers to see the purpose of different code blocks at a glance and make use of common structures quickly and easily. This essentaily makes semantic elements a QoL change.</p>
